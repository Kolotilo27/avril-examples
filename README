Some naive examples of the avril library. Tested on the Shruthi-1 control board hardware.
Ths code is released under a GPL3.0 license.


blink: blink a LED on pin 7.
eeprom: interface with an external i2c eeprom chip.
encoder: simple rotary encoder demo.
lcd: shows how to use the non-blocking LCD class to drive a HD44780-compatible display.
mcp4921: through a simple example (write a sawtooth wave to a MCP4921 DAC), shows how much ass SPI on UART kicks compared to the standard SPI interface.
parallel: uses a block of 4 pins from port D for chasing lights, and another block for a binary counter.
scan_pots: scans 4 potentiometers connected to the analog inputs, and dim 4 LEDs accordingly.
serial_debug: echo one MIDI port to the other one.
switches_and_leds: read some switches press through a multiplexer, and write to 12 LEDs through a shift register.
